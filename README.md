Neural network learning to play snake. The development of this network follows reinforcement learning. If you want to try, download the folder src, install Pygame, PyTorch, Matplotlib, IPython and launch the file agent.py. At the beginning it makes almost random moves, but in a few play you can immediately see the learning, furthermore for each game a .png file is saved and updated in which you can see the learning graph of the network.
