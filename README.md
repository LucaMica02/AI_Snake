# AI_Snake
Neural network learning to play snake.
The development of this network follows reinforcement learning.
If you want try, download the file on src, and install Pygame, PyTorch, Matplotlib, IPython.
At the beginning it makes almost random moves, but in a few games you can immediately see the learning, furthermore for each game a .png file is saved and updated in which you can see the learning graph of the network
